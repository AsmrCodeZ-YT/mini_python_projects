1
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:02,000
- One of my favorite restaurants

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,007
is a little Thai place on the corner of a main road.

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:07,006
When you enter, you're greeted with, sawadee ka,

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:10,001
and the genuine smile of the Thai waitress.

5
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,006
As you're guided to your table,

6
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:13,009
the decor, the smells, the design,

7
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,004
it all feels like you're on the streets of Bangkok.

8
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:17,006
I don't go just for the food.

9
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:20,004
I could get something just as good, but cheaper elsewhere.

10
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:22,002
But I go over the experience.

11
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:24,001
It tells a story.

12
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,004
And when we talk about personal branding,

13
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:28,009
it's about your story.

14
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:32,001
This story that you tell that others remember about you,

15
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,003
this is your reputation and it includes your expertise,

16
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:38,001
your skills, your personality, your tone of voice,

17
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:39,005
how you present yourself,

18
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,009
and even the language that you use.

19
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,002
So at its foundation, personal brand

20
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,007
is about the reputation you forge in the eyes of others

21
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:51,007
through what you consistently say, and more importantly, do.

22
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:53,000
It lies at the intersection

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
between who you are authentically

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,001
and what you want to be known for.

25
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:59,004
In my 10 years of experience in law and banking,

26
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:00,003
and now running

27
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:02,005
a global leadership and performance consultancy,

28
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:05,006
I've come across the full gamut of personal brands.

29
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:08,002
One of my colleagues at a Fortune 500, Terry,

30
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:11,002
stood out for consistently delivering exceptional results

31
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:13,006
while still being one of the most caring people

32
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,008
you'd come across in the organization.

33
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,009
People noticed, and the word spread.

34
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,002
She became highly sought after

35
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,005
and this opened a lot of doors.

36
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:23,003
On the other hand, another senior leader,

37
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:24,006
let's call him Simon,

38
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:27,008
was outspoken about how much he valued his people.

39
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:29,005
Yet, he was abrupt and dismissive

40
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,002
towards subordinates in meetings

41
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:33,005
and seemed to only look out for himself.

42
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:37,001
His brand, a self-serving and disempowering leader.

43
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,009
Although talented, he didn't stick around for long.

44
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,001
While personal brand is all about how people perceive you

45
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:45,006
and the story you create in their minds,

46
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:49,004
it's a function of what you consistently say and do.

47
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:52,001
It's a way of continually reinforcing who you are

48
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,009
and what you stand for in your life and career.

49
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,000
If you are a restaurant, you'd need to ensure

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,008
that your menu, your staff, your chairs, your meal,

51
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:03,000
the smells, all match the story your conveying.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,002
Similarly with your brand,

53
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:06,003
each touchpoint someone has with you

54
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:09,003
needs to be consistently telling the same story.

55
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,004
But this is still not enough.

56
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:13,003
If you truly want to influence your career's trajectory

57
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:14,009
you still need to be intentional

58
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,006
about helping others see, not only where you've been,

59
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:19,003
but where you want to go.

60
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:20,006
It allows you to take control,

61
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:24,000
not only of your present story, but your future story.
