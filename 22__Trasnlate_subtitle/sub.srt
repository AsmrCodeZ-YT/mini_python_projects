1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
(gentle music)

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,005
- The unfortunate fact is,

3
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:05,000
results don't always speak for themselves.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you want to accelerate your career growth,

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
it's not just about how hard you work,

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,001
how talented you are,

7
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:12,003
your experience or your skills.

8
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:13,009
You could be doing the best work,

9
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,004
but if no one knows about you and what you offer,

10
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:18,009
you'll be continually overlooked.

11
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:21,009
This is why becoming intentional about your personal brand

12
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:23,005
could be one of the most powerful

13
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:25,008
career accelerators for you.

14
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:27,006
A strong brand puts you on the radar

15
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:31,002
for exciting career opportunities and greater recognition.

16
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:33,004
It's essential to help you attract attention,

17
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,005
create interest, develop trust,

18
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,007
and ignite a positive emotion in the minds

19
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:39,000
and hearts of others

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,004
when they so much as think about you.

21
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:44,000
In this course, I'll help you to develop your reputation

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,009
and elevate your personal brand

23
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:48,002
using insights from psychology, strategy,

24
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,008
marketing, and creative thinking.

25
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,004
I'm Shade Zahrai, an award-winning leadership strategist

26
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,007

27
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:58,006
I also specialize in helping professionals

28
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:00,007
to accelerate their career.

29
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:02,006
Even if you're an introvert like me,

30
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:05,000
you'll get the tools to boost your brand,

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and your brand is one of the most powerful

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and valuable investment you can make

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:00:56,000
in your confidence, your career, and your life.
